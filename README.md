# personal-projects

I somehow had a brain freeze during the interview and when asked about any personal coding projects I said I didn't have any. While I don't have any successful personal projects I did try to create a few programs while I was locked down last year. Unfortunately, I don't have any of the files since I left them locally on a laptop back in Canada but I'll include a very brief explanation of them. I could easily explain my design process around them and talk about the problem solving that went into creating them.

**An Instagram bot:**
I used selenium chromedriver and python to create an Instagram bot that could run through a given set of hashtags and like relevant pictures from other users to boost a profile's engagement. Unfortunately, Instagram has very good bot detection algorithms and I got too many accounts banned while trying to find ways around them. 

**A python trading bot:**
I used the Alpaca API to create a day trading bot and tried to implement the MartinGale strategy. I managed to implement an algorithm but my paper trades proved that it was quite bad and resulted in vast losses.
